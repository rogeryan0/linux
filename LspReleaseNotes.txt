===============
		This release was built using SDK 4.2.1
		get linux-2.6.22.18 from ww.kernel.org
		change its name to the release name (linux_feroceon_...).
		unzip the release.zip in the directory where you put the kernel, say A to replace all.
		cd to the kernel directory.
		'make mrproper'

4. Known Issues
===============
- Linux kernel panic happens from time to time during boot phase due to initialization
  failure of Marvell switch 6165.

- The following interfaces can not be tested due to lack of board MPPs:
  o DB-88F6281-BP: SDIO and USB device
  o DB-88F6180-BP: USB device

- Kernel panic occurs when using NFP and adding a NAT rule (using iptables) 
  to an illegal network interface.

- Configuration of invalid MTU values in the UBoot mvNetConfig parameter 
  (RD-6281), are passed to Linux without validity check or rounding.
    
- Egiga interface up/down when NFP is enable might generate status messages:
  "Interrupt while in polling list".
     
- NFP routing with SATA stress running at CPU frequency of 800MHz,
  generate overrun error: " bad rx status 2fc3a86b, (overrun error)".

- OpenSSL speed test multiple sessions cause to board terminal ,telnet and ssh 
  sessions to stop working. 
 
- Maxtor HD does not initializes after 3-4 connects/disconnects to PM on board.
  It happens on RD-88F6192-NAS with ports # 1,2,3. 
  The same test on port #0 - pass.

- NFP doesn't support packets with MTU bigger than 1500 Bytes.

- Timeout errors of commands for ATAPI devices can cause to the device to be
  set in offline mode, this issue will be fixed in future releases.

- When disconnecting a SATA device while it used by the kernel (e.g. contains
  unmounted file system), the user must delete the block devices on that 
  channel (using the sysfs), otherwise, farther hotswap events on that channel
  may cause to kernel crash.

  In order to overcome this issue, 
  We recommend that the user will cleanly remove the scsi dev through the sysfs by using the 
  following command:
  #echo 1 > /sys/class/scsi_host/hostH/device/targetH:B:T/H:B:T:L/delete
  Where H, B, T and L stands for Host, Bus, Target and Lun.

  In case that the disk was removed brutally, the udev should detect this event and should remove 
  the device from the sysfs by using the same command as above.

- Thor with PM doesn't work well.

5. Notes
========

- In kernel 2.6.22 the performance on EXT3 is very sensitive to the journaling mode,
  in order to achieve the best performance please use data=writeback.

- This release support up to 512MB of DRAM with current memory layout definition.
